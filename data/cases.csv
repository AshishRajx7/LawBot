"Siddharam Satlingappa Mhetre vs State Of Maharashtra And Ors on 2 December, 2010",https://www.indiankanoon.org/docfragment/1108032/?formInput=Article%2021," 64. In Kharak Singh v. State of U.P. and Others AIR 1963

SC 1295, Subba Rao, J. defined `personal liberty, as a right of an

individual to be free from restrictions or encroachment on his

person whether these are directly imposed or indirectly brought

about by calculated measure.      The court held that `personal

liberty' in Article 21 includes all varieties of freedoms except

those included in Article 19.  65. In Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India and Another (1978)

1 SCC 248, this court expanded the scope of the expression

`personal liberty' as used in Article 21 of the Constitution of

India.     The court rejected the argument that the expression

`personal liberty' must be so interpreted as to avoid overlapping

between Article 21 and Article 19(1). It was observed:    ""The

expression `personal liberty' in Article 21 is of the widest

amplitude and it covers a variety of rights which go to constitute

the personal liberty of a man and some of them have been raised

to the status of distinct fundamental rights and given additional

protection under Article 19."" So, the phrase `personal liberty' is


very wide and includes all possible rights which go to constitute

personal liberty, including those which are mentioned in Article 71.   The object of Article 21 is to prevent encroachment upon

personal liberty in any manner. Article 21 is repository of all

human rights essentially for a person or a citizen. A fruitful and

meaningful life presupposes full of dignity, honour, health and

welfare. In the modern ""Welfare Philosophy"", it is for the State to

ensure these essentials of life to all its citizens, and if possible to

non-citizens. While invoking the provisions of Article 21 , and by

referring to the oft-quoted statement of Joseph Addision, ""Better

to die ten thousand deaths than wound my honour"", the Apex

court in Khedat Mazdoor Chetana Sangath v. State of M.P.

and Others (1994) 6 SCC 260 posed to itself a question ""If

dignity or honour vanishes what remains of life""?         This is the

significance of the Right to Life and Personal Liberty guaranteed

under the Constitution of India in its third part. "

"Secretary, State Of Karnataka And ... vs Umadevi And Others on 10 April, 2006",https://www.indiankanoon.org/docfragment/179794777/?formInput=Article%2014,"32.		At this stage, it is relevant to notice two aspects. In Kesavananda Bharati Vs. State of Kerala (1973 Supp. S.C.R. 1), this 
Court held that Article 14 , and Article 16 , which was described as a facet of Article 14 , is part of the basic structure of the Constitution of India. The 
position emerging from Kesavananada Bharati (supra) was summed up by 
Jagannatha Rao, J., speaking for a Bench of three Judges in Indira Sawhney 
Vs. Union of India (1999 Suppl. (5) S.C.R. 229).  That decision also 
reiterated how neither the Parliament nor the Legislature could transgress the 
basic feature of the Constitution, namely, the principle of equality enshrined 
in Article 14 of which Article 16 (1) is a facet.  This Court stated, "" 33. In the earlier decision in Indra Sawhney Vs. Union of India [1992 Supp. (2) S.C.R. 454), B.P. Jeevan Reddy, J. speaking for the 
majority, while acknowledging that equality and equal opportunity is a basic 
feature of our Constitution, has explained the exultant  position of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India in the scheme of things.  His Lordship 
stated:- Thus, it is clear that adherence to the rule of equality in public employment 
is a basic feature of our Constitution and since the rule of law is the core of 
our Constitution, a Court would certainly be disabled from passing an order 
upholding a violation of Article 14 or in ordering the overlooking of the 
need to comply with the requirements of Article 14 read with Article 16 of 
the Constitution.  Therefore, consistent with the scheme for public 
employment, this Court while laying down the law, has necessarily to hold 
that unless the appointment is in terms of the relevant rules and after a 
proper competition among qualified persons, the same would not confer any 
right on the appointee.  If it is a contractual appointment, the appointment 
comes to an end at the end of the contract, if it were an engagement or 
appointment on daily wages or casual basis, the same would come to an end 
when it is discontinued.  Similarly, a temporary employee could not claim to 
be made permanent on the expiry of his term of appointment.  It has also to 
be clarified that merely because a temporary employee or a casual wage 
worker is continued for a time beyond the term of his appointment, he would 
not be entitled to be absorbed in regular service or made permanent, merely 
on the strength of such continuance, if the original appointment was not 
made by following a due process of selection as envisaged by the relevant 
rules.  It is not open to the court to prevent regular recruitment at the 
instance of temporary employees whose period of employment has come to 
an end or of ad hoc employees who by the very nature of their appointment, 
do not acquire any right.  High Courts acting under Article 226 of the 
Constitution of India, should not ordinarily issue directions for absorption, 
regularization, or permanent continuance unless the recruitment itself was 
made regularly and in terms of the constitutional scheme.  Merely because, 
an employee had continued under cover of an order of Court, which we have 
described as 'litigious employment' in the earlier part of the judgment, he 
would not be entitled to any right to be absorbed or made permanent in the 
service.  In fact, in such cases, the High Court may not be justified in issuing 
interim directions, since, after all, if ultimately the employee approaching it 
is found entitled to relief, it may be possible for it to mould the relief in such 
a manner that ultimately no prejudice will be caused to him, whereas an 
interim direction to continue his employment would hold up the regular 
procedure for selection or impose on the State the burden of paying an 
employee who is really not required.  The courts must be careful in ensuring 
that they do not interfere unduly with the economic arrangement of its 
affairs by the State or its instrumentalities or lend themselves the instruments"

"Union Of India vs Pushpa Rani & Ors on 29 July, 2008",https://www.indiankanoon.org/docfragment/892882/?formInput=Reservation%20Policy,"3.     Shri Amarendra Sharan, learned Additional Solicitor General,

referred to Annexures `A' to `K' appended to letter dated 9.10.2003 to show

that as a result of restructuring of Group C and D cadres, additional posts

became available in the higher grades and argued that the Railway Board

did not commit illegality by issuing direction for implementation of the policy of reservation qua those posts and argued that the policy of reservation was rightly made applicable in relation to the additional posts. In support of this argument he strongly relied on the case of K. Manickaraj

vs. Union of India [1997 (4) SCC 342]. Shri Sharan emphasized that

restructuring of cadres undertaken for enhancing organizational efficiency

and functional, operational and administrative requirements cannot be

treated as a simple exercise for upgradation of existing posts and the

Tribunal did not have the jurisdiction to nullify the instructions issued by

the Railway Board or issue directions for making appointment by ignoring

the policy of reservation . He distinguished the orders passed in Union of

India vs. V.K. Sirothia [1999 SCC (L&S) 938] and All India Non-SC/ST

Employees' Association (Railway) vs. V.K. Agarwal and Others [2001

(10) SCC 165] by pointing out that those were the cases of mass

upgradation of posts and not restructuring of cadres resulting in creation of

additional posts in different grades. 5.       Dr. Rajiv Dhawan, Senior Advocate, appearing for some of the

respondents, argued that restructuring of Group C and D cadres is nothing

but an exercise for upgradation of the existing posts and the Tribunal did

not commit any illegality by striking down para 14 of letter dated 9.10.2003

vide which the policy of reservation was made applicable to the upgraded

posts.    He further argued that if the policy of reservation is applied at the

stage of restructuring of Group C and D cadres then the same would amount

to giving double benefit to the members of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled

Tribes, who had already been given out-of turn promotions. Dr. Dhawan

relied on the larger Bench judgment of this Court in Indra Sawhney and

Others vs. Union of India and Others [1992 Supp. (3) SCC 217] and of

the Constitution Bench in M. Nagaraj and Others vs. Union of India and

Others [2006 (8) SCC 212] and argued that even if the upgraded posts are



required to be filled by promotion after following the process of selection,

the policy of reservation of posts for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled

Tribes cannot be applied qua such posts because no quantifiable data

showing backwardness of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and

inadequacy of their representation was produced before the Tribunal. Dr.

Dhawan made specific reference to paragraphs 85, 86, 106, 117, 119 and

121 of the judgment in M. Nagaraj 's case and argued that the enabling

provision contained in Article 16(4-A) cannot be relied upon by the

appellants to justify implementation of the policy of reservation at the stage

of restructuring of Group C and D cadres because the members of

Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes are adequately represented in those

cadres and efficiency of the administration will be adversely affected by

giving double benefit to them. He then argued that even if para 14 of letter

dated 9.10.2003 is held to be constitutionally valid, the policy of reservation should be made applicable only qua posts which become available after

9.10.2003. Another argument of the learned senior counsel is that if

restructuring exercise is intended to remove stagnation and improve the

quality of services then implementation thereof cannot be made subject to

the policy of reservation . Shri Sushil Jain and Smt. Kiran Suri, Advocates,

adopted the arguments of Dr. Dhawan and submitted that view expressed by



different benches of the Tribunal that the policy of reservation cannot be

applied at the stage of making appointment against the upgraded"
"State Of Raj And Ors vs Vikas Kumar Agarwal And Ors on 2 July, 2013",https://www.indiankanoon.org/docfragment/39736192/?formInput=Reservation%20Policy,"The NCTE in its reply averred that as the academic authority  designated under the Act of 2009, it (NCTE) by its notification dated 23.8.2010 laid down the minimum qualifications for a candidate to be eligible for appointment as Teacher for  Class I to VIII. These norms, which are uniformly applicable to all the States, inter-alia enjoined that a person to be eligible for such appointment would have to pass TET conducted by the appropriate Government in accordance with its (NCTE) guidelines. These guidelines, the answering respondent stated, were circulated vide its letter dated 11.2.2011 whereby in terms of clause-9 thereof, relaxation/concession of/to the qualifying norm of 60% in TET examination was granted vis-a-vis candidates belonging to SC/ST/OBC/differently abled persons in accordance with the extant reservation policy . While clarifying that the process for conducting TET and recruitment of Teachers is within the domain of respective State Governments and that it had no role in these exercises, it (NCTE) underlined that the State Governments were required to adhere to the minimum qualifications and the guidelines  stipulated by it. That the  extent of relaxation in the cut off marks to be granted was also within the jurisdiction and realm of the respective State Governments depending  upon their existing reservation policy , was highlighted as well. The answering respondent explained that the concept of relaxation in TET score ingrained in clause 9(a) of the guidelines dated 11.2.2011 did denote that the appropriate Government was authorized to grant such concession in the minimum pass marks to be obtained in the TET examination by the aforementioned reserved category candidates. This, however, had no nexus with the lowering of minimum qualifying marks at the  secondary or graduation level(academic qualification) for entry in the Teacher Education Course  (s) for the reserved category candidates. While reiterating that as per Clause 9(b) of the guidelines dated 11.2.2011, weightage of the marks secured in the TET examination had to be accorded in the recruitment process, it was contended that relaxation upto 5% marks to the candidates belonging to the reserved category was with regard to the minimum marks specified in paragraph (1) of the notification dated 23.8.2010 relatable to academic qualifications i.e. senior secondary or graduation, as the case may be, for admission into various Teacher Education Courses. According to the NCTE, the relaxation was qua qualifying marks in the academic qualification in conformity with the mandate of the National Council of Teachers Education (Recognized Norms and Procedure) Regulations, 2009 (for short, hereinafter referred to as the Regulations of 2009). This view is fortified by the letter No. F.No.61-1/2011/NCTE/N&S dated 1.4.2011 of the NCTE addressed, amongst others, to all Secretaries and Commissioners of the State Governments/UTs clarifying that following the issuance of the notification dated 23.8.2010, it had received representations from the State Government and other stakeholders that in respect of SCs/STs etc. relaxation upto 5% in the qualifying marks should be allowed, since such relaxation is permissible by the NCTE for admission in various teacher education courses. Referring to the minimum marks in the notification dated 23.8.2010, in senior secondary (or its equivalent) or in B.A./B.Sc., it was elucidated that following its meeting held on 16.3.2011 it was decided that relaxation upto 5% in such qualifying marks would be available to SCs/STs etc., in accordance with the extant policy of the State Government /UTs and other school managements. There is no reference of such relaxation to pass marks in the TET. This accommodation of the NCTE, by way of concession of 5% marks qua the academic qualifications, is also evident from the provisions of the National Council for Teacher Education (Recognition Norms & Procedure) Regulations, 2009 (hereinafter referred to as '2"
